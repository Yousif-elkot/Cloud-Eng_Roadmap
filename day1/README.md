# Python Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my **30-day Python & Cloud Engineering journey**, where I build small projects and steadily improve them.  
Each day introduces a new concept, and over time the projects grow in complexity and quality.

The goal is to strengthen my Python foundations while practicing Git/GitHub workflows, documentation, and professional coding habits — all essential skills for a future Cloud Engineer.

## 📅 Day 1 — Unit Converter

### 🎯 Objective

Build a simple **command-line program** that converts between common units.  
This exercise focuses on:

- Writing basic Python scripts
- Handling user input/output
- Applying arithmetic formulas
- Using `if/elif/else` control flow

---

### ✅ Version 1 (Initial)

- CLI menu with 4 conversion options:
  - Kilometers ↔ Miles
  - Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit
- Program performs **one conversion per run**.
- Demonstrates:
  - `input()` for user input
  - `print()` for formatted output
  - Arithmetic operators for conversion formulas
  - Branching with `if/elif/else`

---

### 🔧 Version 2 (Improvements)

- Added a **loop** so users can perform multiple conversions in one run.
- Introduced an **exit option** (`q` to quit).
- Added **input validation** for menu selection (handles invalid choices gracefully).
- **Refactored into functions** for better code organization and testability.
- Enhanced error handling with `try/except` blocks.
- Professional formatting with type hints and docstrings.

---

### 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced the concept of **control flow** in Python.
- Practiced **function design** and modular programming.
- Learned **type hints** for better code documentation.
- Understood how to iterate on an initial solution, improving usability step by step.
- Gained confidence in using Git to track project versions (commit history shows progress).
- Mastered **exception handling** for robust user input.

---

### 🚀 Next Planned Improvements

- Add **unit tests** to verify conversions.
- Explore handling **edge cases** (e.g., negative temperatures).
- Possibly extend with more unit categories (weight, time, volume).
- Create a configuration file for custom conversion factors.

## 📱 Phone Book CLI Application (Day 1 - Project 2)

### 🎯 Objective

Build a **command-line phone book application** to manage contacts.  
This project introduces:

- Working with Python dictionaries for data storage
- Using the `json` module for data persistence
- Handling user input validation
- Structuring a menu-driven CLI program
- Function-based code organization

---

### ✅ Version 1 (Initial)

- CLI menu with 5 main options:
  - Add new contacts (name + phone number)
  - Search contacts by name
  - Delete contacts with confirmation
  - List all contacts in a clean format
  - Exit with automatic save
- **Data persistence** using `my_contacts.json`
- Demonstrates:
  - Dictionary operations (`add`, `search`, `delete`)
  - File I/O with `json.dump()` and `json.load()`
  - Exception handling with `try/except` (FileNotFoundError)
  - User confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

---

### 🔧 Version 2 (Function-Based Refactor)

- **Modular design** with dedicated functions:
  - `add_contact()` — handles contact creation with validation
  - `search_contact()` — performs contact lookup
  - `delete_contact()` — manages contact removal with confirmation
  - `show_all_contacts()` — displays formatted contact list
  - `show_menu()` — clean menu display
  - `main()` — orchestrates the program flow
- **Enhanced input validation** for empty names and phone numbers.
- **Auto-save functionality** after add/delete operations.
- Professional code structure with proper separation of concerns.

---

### 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Learned how to build **persistent CLI tools** with Python.
- Practiced **separating program logic** from data storage.
- Mastered **function design** and code organization principles.
- Reinforced **error handling** and input validation concepts.
- Strengthened **Git/GitHub skills** by documenting iterations with commits.
- Understood the importance of **user experience** in CLI applications.

---

### 🚀 Next Planned Improvements

- Add **contact editing/updating** functionality.
- Implement **case-insensitive search** with partial matching.
- Store **multiple fields** per contact (email, address, notes).
- Add **data export/import** (CSV format).
- Enhance **phone number validation** with format checking.
- Create **contact categories** (family, work, friends).
- Add **backup and restore** functionality.

## 🎓 Day 1 Overall Progress — What These Projects Taught Me

### 🏗️ **Programming Fundamentals**

- **Control Flow Mastery**: Gained confidence with `if/elif/else`, `while` loops, and program flow
- **Function Design**: Learned to break code into reusable, testable functions with clear purposes
- **Data Structures**: Mastered Python dictionaries for key-value data storage and manipulation
- **Input/Output Handling**: Practiced getting user input, validating it, and providing clear feedback

### 🛠️ **Software Engineering Practices**

- **Code Organization**: Progressed from procedural scripts to well-structured, modular programs
- **Error Handling**: Implemented robust `try/except` blocks for graceful failure management
- **Input Validation**: Built defensive programming habits to handle edge cases and user errors
- **Type Hints & Documentation**: Started using professional coding practices with docstrings

### 💾 **Data Management Skills**
