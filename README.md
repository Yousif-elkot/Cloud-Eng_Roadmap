# Python Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my **30-day Python & Cloud Engineering journey**, where I build small projects and steadily improve them.  
Each day introduces a new concept, and over time the projects grow in complexity and quality.

The goal is to strengthen my Python foundations while practicing Git/GitHub workflows, documentation, and professional coding habits â€” all essential skills for a future Cloud Engineer.

## ðŸ“… Day 1 â€” Unit Converter

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Build a simple **command-line program** that converts between common units.  
This exercise focuses on:

- Writing basic Python scripts
- Handling user input/output
- Applying arithmetic formulas
- Using `if/elif/else` control flow

---

### âœ… Version 1 (Initial)

- CLI menu with 4 conversion options:
  - Kilometers â†” Miles
  - Celsius â†” Fahrenheit
- Program performs **one conversion per run**.
- Demonstrates:
  - `input()` for user input
  - `print()` for formatted output
  - Arithmetic operators for conversion formulas
  - Branching with `if/elif/else`

---

### ðŸ”§ Version 2 (Improvements)

- Added a **loop** so users can perform multiple conversions in one run.
- Introduced an **exit option** (`q` to quit).
- Added **input validation** for menu selection (handles invalid choices gracefully).
- Code is more user-friendly and closer to real-world CLI tools.

---

### ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes

- Reinforced the concept of **control flow** in Python.
- Practiced structuring small programs for clarity and scalability.
- Understood how to iterate on an initial solution, improving usability step by step.
- Gained confidence in using Git to track project versions (commit history shows progress).

---

### ðŸš€ Next Planned Improvements

- Break the code into **modular functions** for better readability.
- Add **unit tests** to verify conversions.
- Explore handling **edge cases** (e.g., non-numeric input).
- Possibly extend with more unit categories (weight, time, etc.).
