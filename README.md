This repository documents my **30-day Python & Cloud Engineering journey**.  
Each project/day has its own folder with code and a detailed README.  
The main README serves as a **timeline + quick guide**.

## 📅 Progress Timeline

### ✅ Day 1 — [Unit Converter](day1/README.md)
- Learned input/output, arithmetic, and control flow.
- Improved with input validation and loops.
- Practiced Git commits and documentation.

### ⏳ Day 2 — [Coming Soon](day2/README.md)
- Will be added once complete.

## 🧑‍💻 Learning Goals
- Strengthen **Python fundamentals** for scripting and automation.  
- Practice **Git/GitHub workflows** (branches, commits, README documentation).  
- Build professional habits: clean code, modular design, version tracking.  
- Apply Python to **Cloud Engineering use-cases** later (automation, DevOps, etc.).
